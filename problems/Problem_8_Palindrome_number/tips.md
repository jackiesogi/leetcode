## Palindrome Number
Becase this problem is different from palindromic string detection (i.e. Problem 5), we cannot directly access every digits like we access the char in a string. Instead we need to continuously divide the input to retrieve the digits.

#### Key point
if a reversed version of input is equal to the input, then it is palindromic.
